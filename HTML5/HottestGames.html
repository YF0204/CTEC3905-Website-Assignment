				<p>Thanks for checking out my website, this page gives you a little information about myself.
				Like I said before, my name is Yaseen, I am 22 and I currently study Computing at DMU in Leicester.
				From the pictures above, you can tell I support the best team in the world, Liverpool FC! YNWA.
				I love to travel, most recently I travelled to Agadir in Morocco which had amazing weather.
				Also, as you can tell from the website, Video Games are a great passion of mine and are the main reason
				why I built this website around the theme. </p>

				power, a 4K Blu-ray player and HDR support. Microsoft have certainly built themselves an impressive machine that
