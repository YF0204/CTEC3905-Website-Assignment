				<p>Thanks for checking out my website, this page gives you a little information about myself.
				Like I said before, my name is Yaseen, I am 22 and I currently study Computing at DMU in Leicester.
				From the pictures above, you can tell I support the best team in the world, Liverpool FC! YNWA.
				I love to travel, most recently I travelled to Agadir in Morocco which had amazing weather.
				Also, as you can tell from the website, Video Games are a great passion of mine and are the main reason
				why I built this website around the theme. </p>

				<p>It all started when I was 2 maybe 3 years old when I got my Sega MegaDrive. I couldn't believe what
				I was seeing. Sonic the Hedgehog running and looping all over the screen and Scorpion ripping out Sub-Zero's
				spinal cord out. I was hooked in seconds. Since then I have owned pretty much every console released and experienced 
				many incredible gaming experiences such Uncharted, The Last of Us, Gears of War, Lylat Wars and Crash Bandicoot.</p>
