# Project Summary
For this assignment, I will be building a semantic HTML5 website with a responsive design. I have decided to make the website based on video gaming as it is one of my greatest passions. From this module, I have learnt that when you are creating a website you must conform to information architecture standards. This means that websites should help users effortlessly find information and complete tasks, in order to create a high level of usability. During this assignment, I plan to achieve something along those lines. Below you will find my development process, along with any issues I faced & resolved and final thoughts.  

## Development Process

### Starting Off 

**Webpages, Layout and Structure**
I started the process off by thinking about the number of webpages I will create and the overall colour/tone of the website. After some time, I decided to make five webpages. These included a standard homepage which contains the latest news/events, reviews section, list of hottest/anticipated games, about me page and a contact form. Also, I will try to keep the website in a consistent and structured layout to maintain a level of usability and accessibility. 

**Target Audience, Colour, Font and Tone**
The website is mainly aimed at gamers or people who are interested in taking up gaming as hobby. To keep the website nice and simple, I chose the colours, blue, black and white, along with the font Calibri which is easy to read. The headers and footers will have a blue background with white text and the main body/section of each page will contain black text and other appropriate media displayed neatly.

### Prototype

I created rough webpages to get an idea of what the final product will look like. Below you can see some examples:

**Homepage** - A standard homepage which will contain latest news & events and trending news displayed in a slideshow controlled by JS.

**About Me** - A page which provides information about myself.

**Hottest Games** - List of most wanted games.

**My Reviews** - My own reviews on recently launched games.

**Contact Form** - A user input form coded by JS where people can send messages, feedback etc.

This is a full navigation model, which I will use as the basis of my website. With this type of structure, users can navigate from page to page with ease and find information efficiently.
